Rackspace Application Services (RAS) Digital Experience Application
Operations is the Rackspace managed-services suite of offerings for digital
experience platforms (web content management and eCommerce) as well as any
Java™ or .Net-based applications.

Fully-managed services include Rackspace expert
consulting, proactive monitoring, troubleshooting, and managing your
applications. It also now includes options for the Application
Performance Management (APM) tools suite, enabling you to choose tools based on
your preference and need for advanced business intelligence and budget.

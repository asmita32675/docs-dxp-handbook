Rackspace Application Services (RAS) Digital Experience Application
Operations is the Rackspace managed services suite of offerings for digital
experience platforms (web content management and eCommerce) as well as any
Java™ or .Net-based applications.

Fully managed services include Rackspace expert
consultation, proactive monitoring, troubleshooting, and management of your
applications. It also now includes options for the Application
Performance Management (APM) tools suite, enabling you to choose tools based on
your preference and need for advanced business intelligence and budget.

If you don't want fully managed services and use Sitecore®, Sitecore
Commerce, Adobe® Experience
Manager, SAP® Hybris, or Oracle® cCommerce/ATG, you can choose to have
access to only Rackspace experts without the other benefits of a fully
managed experience.

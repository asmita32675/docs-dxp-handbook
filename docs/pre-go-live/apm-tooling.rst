=============================
Add your teams to APM tooling
=============================

You can ask the RAS Digital Experience team to provide you with
read-only access to either AppDynamics or New RelicÂ® so that you can view the
dashboard and metrics. Because you have read-only access, you must submit
a ticket to the RAS Digital Experience team to request a change to any
devices or application you are monitoring.

If you want another member of your organization or a third party to access
the APM tool, you must provide the Digital Experience team with the
following information for that person or party:

* First name
* Last name
* Email address

If you want a third party to be able to create tickets or call Rackspace
Support for help, consider the following guidelines:

* The third party must be added to the Rackspace Customer Portal. If a use
  is not defined in our system, we cannot provide support. Due to
  confidentiality, we are prevented from providing any kind of information.
* If you add a third party to the Rackspace Customer Portal, we assume that
  they are also entitled to use pre-purchased consulting hours.

Resolve emergency incidents
===========================

Each production environment has a monitor that constantly assesses the
availability of that environment. If the environment becomes unavailable, the
monitor automatically creates an Emergency ticket that notifies the
Rackspace RAS engineer of the issue. We handle Emergency tickets, which are the
highest level of severity, with urgency.

The Rackspace RAS engineer takes the following actions upon notification
of the Emergency incident:

* Acknowledges the alert in the Rackspace Customer Portal
* Reviews the Account Management Guidelines and the Operations Runbook to
  determine how to proceed
* Opens a call bridge and includes the appropriate personnel on your team,
  such as the DBA or network administrator
* Notifies all stakeholders by using a *tie-in hitch* that an issue has
  occurred, what the issue is, if the issue is ongoing, and that Rackspace
  is actively troubleshooting it. The tie-in hitch mechanism ensures that all
  Emergency incidents get the proper review and attention.

The Emergency incident handling process is more efficient when there is an
Operations Runbook that provides the RAS engineer with the procedures to
follow. The runbook can help the RAS engineer determine the steps to
take in a site-down scenario.

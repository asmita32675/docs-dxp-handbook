Request maintenance
===================

You must submit a ticket to request maintenance any time that you expect
Rackspace to work on your application. You need maintenance when
a change results in downtime or could have an impact on service
availability. While maintenance is typically associated with deploying code
or configuration changes, you also need maintenance for small changes,
including activating and deactivating a user.

When you request maintenance, you must:

* Make the service request at least 48 hours in advance. We schedule
  maintenance on a first-come, first-served basis.
* Provide as much detail as possible, including the build number, the type
  of maintenance (deployment, patch, or configuration change), how long
  the maintenance should take, and any other technical details that help
  us provide a smooth maintenance process.

The sooner you provide your detailed maintenance request, the better the
outcome.

**Why does Rackspace request 48 hours notice?**

A lot of preparation goes into ensuring that your maintenance goes smoothly.
As soon as you make your request, we review it, prepare for the maintenance,
quality check our preparation, and then schedule the maintenance. You might
receive a request from the RAS team to schedule a maintenance call
within 24 hours after you submit your ticket.

Additionally, all maintenance is subject to calendar availability. The best
plan is to contact Rackspace with notice as soon as you have a firm date
and time preference so we can confirm availability. The technical details
can come later.

To notify Rackspace of planned maintenance, open a ticket in the Rackspace
login portal that describes the event and includes the proposed date,
time, and time zone. Rackspace uses this ticket to communicate with you
for the duration of the event. The ticket is also the best place to
upload written plans and the files necessary for proper event execution.

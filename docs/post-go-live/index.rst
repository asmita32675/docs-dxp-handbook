Post go-live activities
=======================

From the moment you go live with your solution, RAS Digital Experience teams
across all shifts are ready to provide ongoing support. Each Digital
Experience team has participated in internal knowledge transfer sessions that
educate participants about the particular aspects of your deployment.

At this time, alert monitors are in place, automatic ticket creation is
enabled, and a runbook that provides detailed and actionable steps to take
for each alert type is in place. From this point forward, the RAS
implementation phase is complete and your environment is being monitored.

Refer to the following sections to ensure that your monitoring solution
continues to run smoothly after you go live.

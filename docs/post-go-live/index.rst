Post go-live activities
=======================

From the moment you go live with your solution, RAS Digital Experience teams
across all shifts are ready to provide ongoing support. Each Digital
Experience team has participated in internal knowledge-transfer sessions that
educate participants about the particular aspects of your deployment.

At this time, you should have the following:

- Enabled automatic ticket creation
- Alert monitors in place
- A runbook that provides detailed and actionable steps to take for each alert
  type

From this point forward, the RAS implementation phase is complete, and your
environment is being monitored.

Refer to the following sections to ensure that your monitoring solution
continues to run smoothly after you go live.

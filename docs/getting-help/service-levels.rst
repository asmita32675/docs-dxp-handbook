Service levels

Applicable service levels depend on the services that you purchased. The following
service levels might not apply.

Incident Response: Requests are categorized into three tiers:

* **Standard**: If your site is functioning within acceptable parameters but
  you require assistance in loading software or have a help desk-type
  question, Rackspace responds to your request within four hours.
* **Urgent**: If your server or site is accessible but in a reduced state,
  such as timeouts or slow response, Rackspace responds to your request within
  one hour.
* **Emergency**: If you cannot access your server or site from the public
  Internet, Rackspace responds within 15 minutes.

All submitted requests are automatically categorized as **Standard** requests.
Rackspace responds to your support requests in the timelines listed below.

.. note:: For requests that require an **Urgent** or **Emergency**
classification, call the 24x7x365 support line directly.

RAS Digital Experience does not include any new Service Level Agreements (SLAs)
to which you subscribe.

  Exclusions apply. Credits that would be available but for this limitation
  shall not be carried forward to future months. You are not entitled to a
  credit for a failure to meet guarantees resulting from circumstances that
  are not within Rackspace control. You are not entitled to a credit if you
  are in breach of the Agreement (including your payment obligations to
  Rackspace) at the time of the occurrence of the event giving rise to the
  credit until you have cured the breach. You are not entitled to a credit
  if the event giving rise to the credit would not have occurred but for
  your breach of the Agreement. You must request a credit through your
  Rackspace account within 14 days following the event giving rise to the
  credit. Rackspace shall contact you within 30 days to approve or reject
  the claim or to request more information. If the claim is approved, the
  credit shall appear on your monthly invoice following approval. The SLA
  described in this section is limited to your configuration and does
  not extend to your end users or to other Rackspace Services. You acknowledge
  that any changes made pursuant to this section may not be effective in
  removing an attacker or preventing the attack from damaging your
  configuration.

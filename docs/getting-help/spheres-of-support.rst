Spheres of Support
==================

RAS Digital teams provide support and management of your application. Below are
the Spheres of Support (SoS) for Java and .NET applications. Each named
application (Sitecore, AEM, Oracle Commerce, and SAP Hybris) has its own
SoS.

Supporting your Digital Experience environment involves two or more parties,
specifically:

* You, referred to as Customer (including any in-house IT resources) and your
  Systems Integrator (SI), if any
* Rackspace Support experts

The following RACI tables include the following roles and relationships:

* **Responsible**: The party who carries out the process or task assignment
  and is responsible to get the job done.
* **Accountable**: The party who is ultimately accountable for the process or
  task being completed appropriately.
* **Consulted**: Parties who are not directly involved with carrying out the
  task, but who are consulted and might be a stakeholder or subject matter
  expert.
* **Informed**: Parties who receive output from the process or task or who have
  a need to stay informed.

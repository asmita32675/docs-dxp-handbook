============================
Who can contact the RAS team
============================

While you might work with internal and external resources such as system
integrators, content teams, and other agencies, our contract is with you.
All requests (for production systems or otherwise) must come from a member
of your team or one of your approved contacts so we can ensure that any
requested actions are in line with the details of the established support
agreement.

To speed communication and issues resolution, you can add your systems
integrator or partners as approved contacts. It's our preference to have
regular communications with your entire decision-making team so that we can
better understand critical road-mapping discussions for activities such as
expansion, upgrades, and migrations.

To request the addition of a system integrator or partner as a contact, open a
ticket providing their information and any details on when to contact them
(for example, contact them if an off-hours outage requiring a custom code
fix occurs).

Lastly, if you have any general billing or account-related questions, your
Account Manager can assist you. Open a ticket and state that you have an
Account Management question.

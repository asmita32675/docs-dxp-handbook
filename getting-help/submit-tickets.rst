Submitting tickets
==================

You can submit RAS Digital Experience support requests at any time by creating
a ticket in the Rackspace Customer Portal or by phone.

To create a support ticket or view existing tickets, log in to the
`Rackspace Customer Portal <https://login.rackspace.com/>`_ and then click
**Tickets** in the top navigation bar. The Rackspace automated systems also
create tickets for events on your account that require either your attention
or a Rackspace employee's attention. You can also call the 24x7x365
Support team at any time.

Any actionable information needs to reside in a ticket because this is the
Rackspace system of record to ensure that we fully document any issues or
requests from identification to resolution.

An example of an action might be as simple as viewing a particular log file
for data, such as resolving an application issue, or as
complex as managing an application code release or upgrade. The ticket
provides the immediate value of centralized information and communication
while meeting the long-term needs of cross-referencing events for
correlation or viewing historical activity or decisions that impact the
application.

Keep the following guidelines in mind regarding ticket communication:

* RAS Digital teams recognize that many enterprise social media and
  communication tools (such as email, Slack, Yammer, and instant messaging)
  offer powerful collaboration functionality and play a role in the timely
  communication of critical information related to an issue, but they are not
  systems of record nor are they actively monitored. Using these tools for
  critical communication leads to the risk of inaction or missed issues.

* If you have questions or require Rackspace assistance, open a ticket in the
  Rackspace Customer Portal. Using tickets ensures that communication does
  not get lost in email or isolated to a single individual. Instead, it's
  rather supported by
  the team for timely resolution. *If your production system is down or you
  are experiencing a highly urgent and severely disruptive issue, call us
  directly after you submit a ticket.*

* There might be instances in which you and Rackspace need to speak instead of
  writing. If a meeting is required, the Rackspace Customer Success
  Manager schedules that meeting. Depending on the meeting outcome, we
  might generate tickets to track items for a timely resolution.

* Ongoing roadmap discussions are scheduled with you by the Rackspace
  Account Manager at a regular cadence to discuss any open items and future
  plans for your Digital Application environment. You must open a ticket for
  any items that require action.

* The Rackspace application monitoring system generates tickets if certain
  thresholds are met or issues are discovered.

* There might be instances in which Rackspace proactively discovers issues and
  opportunities and brings them to your attention, such as an issue generated
  by a code deployment made by your team. The vast majority of issues that
  Rackspace discovers relates to deployed code or configuration changes.

* If you don't respond to a ticket that requires immediate input, such as a
  site down, Rackspace might contact you by using the information on file.


Example tickets
---------------

Providing the needed information in a ticket reduces the back-and-forth
communication with Rackspace, resulting in delays in resolving your issue.

When you create a ticket, ensure that you provide the following information:

* The device or devices that are experiencing the issue

  * The device must be within the scope of your RAS contract.
  * As a best practice, if you use the Rackspace Customer Portal to manage
    your devices, add a meaningful nickname to each device to help keep them
    organized. For example, for your production website, enter the nickname
    **Prod Web**. This feature is not available in the Cloud Control Panel.

* A detailed description of the issue
* A description of any changes you might have made before the issue occurred,
  such as code changes, architectural changes, or campaigns that resulted in a
  higher volume of traffic
* Identify if you can reproduce the issue in your development or test
  environment. If so, provide the steps so that Rackspace can recreate the
  issue.
* Provide a log file or error message, if applicable
* The contact number of a person that Rackspace can contact if more information
  is needed

.. note::
   If you request a device restart, indicate which device or devices
   you want to restart and the time of day that you want the restart to
   happen. If you have multiple devices to restart, determine whether you want
   a rolling restart where individual devices are restarted separately and in
   sequence.
